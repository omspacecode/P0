Worst Case Big-O Notation

=============================================================================================
Task0:
Since this task involves picking up the first text record and last call record.
>> O(1)
=============================================================================================
Task1:
When the list range is huge in range, there might evidence of worst case scenario
>> O(n2)

=============================================================================================
Task2:
When there are multiple numbers that have spent exact same duration on call.
It will be worst case as to which records needs to picked up for the max duration
>> O(n)
=============================================================================================
Task3:
When the list contains data which consists of 080 with the braces, it will not be able to find a match and hence fall as the worst case.
>> O(n)

=============================================================================================
Task4:

If there are numbers that are telemarketers but start from number different from 140 will not be matched and falling in the worst case scenario.
>> O(n)
