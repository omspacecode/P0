Worst Case Big-O Notation

=============================================================================================
Task0:
Since this task involves picking up the first text record and last call record.
>> O(1)
=============================================================================================
Task1:
When the list range is huge in range, there might evidence of worst case scenario
>> O(n2)

=============================================================================================
Task2:
When there are multiple numbers that have spent exact same duration on call.
It will be worst case as to which records needs to picked up for the max duration
>> O(n)
=============================================================================================
Task3:
Since it will take linear time to fetch the data from lists and then we have performed sorting which will take O(nlogn).
>> Total runtime complexity is O(nlogn).

=============================================================================================
Task4:

Since it will take linear time to fetch the data from lists and then we have performed sorting which will take O(nlogn).
>> Total runtime complexity is O(nlogn).
